a). The inputs would be the five numbers. (number_one, number_two, number_three, number_four, number_five)

b). The output would be the largest number. In my program, I just display the input of the largest number.

c). An error would arise if the user inputted strings instead of an integer. 

d).
READ number_one
READ number_two
READ number_three
READ number_four
READ number_five

IF number_one>=number_two and number_one>=number_three and number_one>=number_four and number_one>=number_five THEN
 DISPLAY number_one
ELSE
 IF number_two>=number_one and number_two>=number_three and number_two>=number_four and number_two>=number_five THEN
  DISPLAY number_two
 ELSE
  IF number_three>=number_one and number_three>=number_two and number_three>=number_four and number_three>=number_five THEN
    DISPLAY number_three
  ELSE
   IF number_four>=number_one and number_four>=number_two and number_four>=number_three and number_four>=number_five THEN
    DISPLAY number_four
   ELSE
    IF number_five>=number_one and number_five>=number_two and number_five>=number_three and number_five>=number_four THEN
     DISPLAY number_five

e). Test Case 1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
    Test Case 2 = [-5,0,4,3,2]
    Test Case 3 = [3,3,3,3,3]
    Test Case 4 = [100000, 4050494, 747474, 4949389, 474738]
    Test Case 5 = ['a','b','c','d','e']

f). Minimum number of operations would be 10.
g). Maximum number of operations would be 27.
