a). Inputs would be 'code'. The variable 'code' stores the EAN-13 code.

b). Output would be 'Accept' or 'Reject' based on the outcome of the variable 'code' entered.

c). Some errors would be entering more or less than 13 digit codes, entering a string or double instead of integers.

d). For this algorithm I will use EAN-13.

READ code

SET Task_one_code TO code
SET Task_two_code TO code

FOR count=0 to 13:
 COMPUTE digit AS (int(Task_one_code)) % 10
 COMPUTE Task_one_code AS int(Task_one_code/10)
 IF (count % 2) == 0 then
  COMPUTE sum_of_even_digit AS sum_of_digit + digit
 ENDIF
ENDFOR
 
COMPUTE Task_one as sum_of_even_digit % 10

FOR count=0 to 13:
 COMPUTE digit AS (int(Task_two_code)) % 10
 COMPUTE Task_two_code AS int(Task_two_code/10)
 IF (count % 2) != 0 then
  COMPUTE sum_of_odd_digit AS sum_of digit + digit
 ENDIF
ENDFOR

COMPUTE Task_two AS sum_of_odd_digit % 10

COMPUTE Task_three AS (Task_two * 3) % 10

COMPUTE Task_four AS (Task_one + Task_three) % 10

IF Task_four == 0 then
 DISPLAY Accept
ELSE
 DISPLAY Reject
ENDIF

e). Test Case 1=[8904117400758]
    Test Case 2=[ajoidjaop]
    Test Case 3=[465363728219]

f). 129(59 + 59 + 11=129) number of operations. 59 for task one loop. 59 for task two loop. 11 for other operations.

g). 129(59 + 59 + 11=129) number of operations. 59 for task one loop. 59 for task two loop. 9 for other operations.
